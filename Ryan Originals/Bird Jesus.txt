Verse 1:
       A                                                                                                  
I was floatin’ on the sea, when out of nowhere; 
   A
a head popped up from the water, couldn’t help but stare
          D                                         
He was a daffy motherfucker, floatin’ on the water; 
        A             
and I caught the next wave and didn’t think about it further.
         E                                            
When I turned back around, and paddled out back
          D                                           D7
He was a splishin’ and splashin’ like he was takin’ a bath!

Chorus:
             A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
             A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the jellies got no problem with me
                A                   
Out here we’re free!  Whooooooaaah 
E                 D     D7
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohh

Verse 2:
         A                                                                                            
So, it wasn’t very long until I realized, 
      A
this bird couldn’t swim; I could see it in his eyes.
      D                                                   A         
So, I paddled on over, slid my board under, and he hopped on.
E                                                  
Hang on brother, we’re headed in, 
        D                            D7                  
Just a few more minutes, you’ll be flying in the wind!!

Chorus:
             A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
             A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the jellies got no problem with me
                A                   
Out here we’re free!  Whooooooaaah 
E                 D     D7
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohh

Verse 3:
A                                                                                    
Waves passing under; things are goin’ smooth.  
A
Where the waves break, we’re comin’ up to and a
D 
Big peak is comin’, better hold on tight; 
A
‘cause we’re catching a ride, or an unexpected flight!
          E                                               
But if we beat the odds, and make it back in,
       D                           D7     
we can hang on the beach until you fly again!

Chorus:
             A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
             A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the jellies got no problem with me
                A                   
Out here we’re free!  Whooooooaaah 
E                 D     D7
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohh

Verse 4:
A                                                                                                 
Cruised past the breakers now we’re walking on shore; 
     A
I’m strolling on the beach with this bird up on my board.
        D                                                A          
People lookin’ at us like they’ve, never seen a surfing fowl!
     E                                           
And dryin’ his feathers, safely on shore
D                                 D7                                                  
Quoth that thankful raven, “I’ll surf nevermore!”

Chorus:
             A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
             A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the jellies got no problem with me
                A                   
Out here we’re free!  Whooooooaaah 
E                 D     D7
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Ohh
