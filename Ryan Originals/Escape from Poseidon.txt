Intro:
Looking back it was a failed decision,
Poseidon's crown had become an obsession.

Alternate Intro:
Going forward on a sea of sadness
Poseidon's crown had become an obsession.

IDEAS
Atlantis = madness
descending

Descending into Atlantas, not realizing this was madness
All I wanted was his crown, but didn't know how it'd go down
- gets crown, escaping, treasure loses from his hands, "trident flame" passes by his head
- wackaraw, wackaraw, brow and salt, in the grip of a tentacle I'm caught
In darkened waters, in the lair, I see Poseidon's daughter, combing her mermaid hair..
If I would have planned better, would have brought a weapon instead of just a board

Deciding it was still a good idea, walked up to Poseidon, sleeping on his thrown,
  did a pre-emptive smite and punched him in the face.
Army of seahorses chasing me now, I'm paddling like hell away with the sea lord's crown
Beckoning to the beast, as the Kraken gets released, you multi-armed goofball!
I'm in a predicament, as I can tell, on my board now, 
  one finger in the air as I paddle like hell!

As trident flames fly past my head, I'm assuming now that he wants me dead!
as I'm trying to get onto land, the stolen treasure falls from my hand

Chorus:
No escape, No escape, No escape, from Poseidon
No escape, No escape, No escape, from Poseidon
No escape, No escape, No escape, from Poseidon

End:
Now I know, this is how it ends
  the Kraken looks at me and grins (yeahhhhh)

Outro:
No escape, No escape, No escape......


**** funniest part, there is no reason to do any of this!?!
