Stompin through the forrest weavin in and outta trees,
People think he's scary but he's really pretty sweet
Big hairy feet and a stride you'd recognize,
It's hard to go surfin when you're a creature of his size

So just grab your boards and go down to the shore,
All the sweetest people that I know, hang down there

Go wet Yeti, go wet Yeti,
Go wet Yeti, go wet Yeti,
Go wet Yeti, go wet Yeti, goooooo
... down to Cherry Grove
