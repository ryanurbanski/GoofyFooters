All We Get
Goofy Footers

Verse 1:
D                   
Somewhere in between
A       G                             
The life we live and the life we leave
D             
Is our reality
D                        
We’re running far behind 
A    G                           
Of Who we are and who we could be
D           
Our identity

Pre-Chorus:
G        D                         
But the truth is we’re so much more
A    G                           
Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
A         G                   
A little bit more than we know
             A     
If we pay attention
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
A    G                          
With every kindness that we show
   A                     
Live with good intentions
G                             A               D 
Cause a little bit of life is all we get       

Verse 2:
D        
Ambiguity
A   G                     
Whispers in the very heart
          D   
Of my morality
D                   
Something in me sees
A                  G    
The endless waves of our
  D               
…our Possibilities

Pre Chorus:
G        D                         
But the truth is we’re so much more
A    G                           
Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
A         G                   
A little bit more than we know
                       A 
If we pay attention     
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
A    G                          
With every kindness that we show
   A                     
Live with good intentions
G                  A               D    
Cause a little bit of life is all we get

Musical Interlude:
D A E D 

Bridge:
G    D                        
I know that I must make amends
G        D                          
For all my fucked up downward trends
G    D                         
And as you take this recompense
    A              
Know that I see you
G         D                         
And the truth is we are so much more
A    G                           
Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
A         G                   
A little bit more than we know
                       A 
If we pay attention     
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
A    G                          
With every kindness that we show
   A                     
Live with good intentions
G                     A               D  
Cause a little bit of life is all we get
