Single Fin/Single Gear [Intro] F C Em C F G C C x 2 (Chorus) [Verse 1] 
C F 
Cool of the morning backing down to the shore 
C F 
Roaster Crowed and I was headed out the Door 
C F 
Single gear cruising is the way for me 
G F F 
Simple life’s best; That’s a guarantee 
[Chorus] 
F C Em F 
Slide and glide; come on enjoy the ride 
C F 
Single Fin slipping down a glassy line 
G C C 
Everyone’s feeling fine. 
[Verse 2] 
C F 
Living for the swell is the only way 
C F 
You wake up happy every single day 
C F 
Riches don’t matter if you live on stoke 
G F F 
You can die a happy man even though your broke 
[Chorus x 2] 
F C Em F 
Slide and glide; come on enjoy the ride 
C F 
Single Fin slipping down a glassy line 
G C C 
Everyone’s feeling fine. [Outro after the last chorus] F C Em C F G C C x 2 (Chorus)
