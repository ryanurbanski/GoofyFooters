Verse 1
G6            Gdim7          
I stared at the sea with pity
G6        Gdim7           
Waves blown out and shitty
G6              Gdim7         
I saw her standing by the pier
G6              Gdim7           
Said, “Girl, let’s have a beer.”
G6                    D7              
I should have known what she was about
G6                    D7          
‘Cause she said no and paddles out

I thought…

Chorus
G6                 Gdim7     
May your wetsuit never    dry
G6               Gdim7            
May you always have waves   to try
 G6                Gdim7       
I know I don’t have    a chance
 G6                 D           D7    
‘Cause only with the wind    you dance
  G6                     Gdim7                  
You’re a surfer    girl     dreaming of the curl
  G6               Gdim                  D      
Waves    are your world,     ...  are your world

Verse 2
G6             Gdim7  
We collected souvenirs
G6                Gdim7           
As we dated for two and half years
G6            Gdim7         
Costa Rica, California Kauai
G6              Gdim7      
Chasing swells we would fly
G6          D7            
I knew it would never last
G6             D7         
I felt like I was her past
I wrote…

Chorus
G6                 Gdim7     
May your wetsuit never    dry
G6               Gdim7            
May you always have waves   to try
 G6                Gdim7       
I know I don’t have    a chance
 G6                 D           D7    
‘Cause only with the wind    you dance
  G6                     Gdim7                  
You’re a surfer    girl     dreaming of the curl
  G6               Gdim                  D      
Waves    are your world,     ...  are your world

Bridge
Bm                 
Your one track mind
A                     
Is truly one of a kind
BM                    
The only way you’ll be
A                            
Is the swell setting you free

I hope…

Chorus
G6                 Gdim7     
May your wetsuit never    dry
G6               Gdim7            
May you always have waves   to try
 G6                Gdim7       
I know I don’t have    a chance
 G6                 D           D7    
‘Cause only with the wind    you dance
  G6                     Gdim7                  
You’re a surfer    girl     dreaming of the curl
  G6               Gdim                  D      
Waves    are your world,     ...  are your world
