Piece of the Whole

Verse
D                              C                             G                              
Sometimes you feel the earth shift under your feet
                                 C                        Em	                
And everyone’s a stranger that you meet
                             C                         G
Looking for the one thing you can keep
                             D
To make life complete

Chorus
 D                              C                             G                                    
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole
                             C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
                          C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
                  D
And play the game
                                    C
Just give it one more day

Verse
D                              C                             G  	                
You’re breathing in smoke and it's making you blind
                           C                        Em	                
Searching for a different kind of high
                                 C                     G
Just to be numb would be so sublime
                                    D
But you dig deep and find

Chorus
 D                              C                             G                                    
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole
                             C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
                          C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
                  D
And play the game
                                    C
Just give it one more day


Verse
D                              C                             G        	                
So when the day is long and the work is hard
                                 C                        Em	                
When you feel you haven’t gotten very far
                             C                    G
Just look up to the sky and pick a star
                       D
And follow it home
                            C
You’re never all alone

Chorus
                                        
C                              G                                                                 
You’re a piece of the whole
                               C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
                          C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
                  D
And play the game
                                    G
Just give it one more day
C                           Em
Is a piece of the whole
 D                              C                    Em   
Every dead end is a different road
 D                              C                    Em   
Pick up the dice and give them a roll
              D
And play the game
                                    G
Just give it one more day
