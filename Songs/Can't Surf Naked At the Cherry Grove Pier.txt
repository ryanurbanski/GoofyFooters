Should have known things would go too far
    A
    after travel cats burned down the bar

The moon is full and the waves are pumping...

    Let's go do somethin'

The moon is full and the waves are pumping...

Listen up you hippie surfing freaks
    A
    the moonlight reflection can't tan your cheeks
E                                     D
One thing is certain and one thing is clear
         A
    you can't surf naked at the Cherry Grove Pier

Verse 2:
A
Feet hit the sand don't you know
    A
    Clothes were the first thing to go
D
Tina and Luke hit the waves
    A
     Little did we know there will be hell to pay
    E                    D
The moon is full and the waves are pumping...
    A
    let's go do somethin'

Chorus:
D
Listen up you hippie surfing freaks
    A
    the moonlight reflection can't tan your cheeks
E                                     D
One thing is certain and one thing is clear
         A
    you can't surf naked at the Cherry Grove Pier

Verse 3:
A
The moon was full in more ways than one
    A
    we were in the ocean having fun
D
The surf was up and the waves were hot
    A
    oh my god who called the cops!?
E
The fuzz is here and we're full of fear...
    A
    let's get the hell out of here!
