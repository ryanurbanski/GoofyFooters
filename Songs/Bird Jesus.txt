Verse 1
A                                                                                                  
Floatin’ on the sea, when out of nowhere; a head popped out from the water; Couldn’t help but stare
         D                                                     A             
He was a daffy motherfucker floatin’ in the water; and I caught the next wave
                                  E                                            
Didn’t think about it further.  Than I turned back around; And paddled out back
       D                                               
He was splishin’ and splashin’ like he’s takin’ a bath!

Chorus
           A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
           A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the Jelliers got no problem with me
A

Verse 2
A                                                                                            
So, it wasn’t very long until I realized this bird couldn’t swim; I could see it in his eyes.
       D                                               A         
So, I paddled on over, and slid my board under; And he hopped on.
E                                                  
Hang on Buddy, we’re headin’ in!  It won’t be long.
D                                              
Few more minutes, you’ll be flying in the wind!

Chorus
           A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
           A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the Jelliers got no problem with me

Verse 3
A                                                                                    
Waves passing under; things goin’ smooth.  Where the waves break, we’re comin’ up to.
 D                                                A                                               
A big peak is comin’; better hold on tight; ‘cause we’re catching a ride; Or an unexpected flight!
E                                               
But if we beat the odds and and make it back in,
D                                            
we can hang on the beach until you fly again!

Chorus
           A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
           A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D

Verse 4
            A                                                                                                 
Cruised on past the breaker; now we’re walking on shore; I’m strolling on the beach with this bird on the bow.
     D                                           A          
People lookin’ at us like they’ve never seen a surfing fowl;
E                                           
As he’s dryin’ his feathers safely on shore,
A                                                  
Quoth that thankful raven,   “I’ll surf nevermore!”

Chorus
           A                       
O hey there bird!  Swimmin’ with me
           A                    
O hey there bird! Out in the sea
D                                             
Sharks and the Jelliers got no problem with me
