V1
C		         Em7	A7
Waking up early for Dawn patrol
Dm7		          Ab7     G7
Linda's already down at the pier
C		       Em7	A7
Last night got a bit out of control
	     Dm7	       Ab7    G7
Cause we all had way too many beers

V2
C		     Em7       A7
We're all stiff and sleep deprived 
	Dm7		        Ab7     G7
but it's ok cause we're one happy tribe
C			Em7     A7
So much of this life is so contrived
      Dm7		     Ab7	        G7
Sunrise and surf make a beautiful vibe 

Chorus
F		     G7
    Bottom turning, cut back twice
	      C				A7
And then I stick out my foot for that cheater five
	Dm7		      G7
Cuz a longboard cruising down the wave
C        G	             F
Is the feeling that I crave


      C			              Em7	A7
The sun is peaking over the horizon now
      Dm7	        Ab7     G7
The sky is pink and pastel blue
C			     Em7    A7
John is getting out of the water now
     Dm7	      Ab7      G7
He has to take his kid to school


C				Em7   A7
Brandon's gonna cancel his meeting
     Dm7		       Ab7       G7
Because the waves are three foot and clean
C			    Em7    A7
Cecil’s no good at wave reading 
	   Dm7			         Ab7   G7
We don't care ‘cause friendly’s our local scene 

Chorus
F		     G7
    Bottom turning, cut back twice
	      C				A7
And then I stick out my foot for that cheater five
	Dm7		      G7
Cuz a longboard cruising down the wave
C        G	             F
Is the feeling that I crave

C        G	  F
Da da da da da ta…etc...
