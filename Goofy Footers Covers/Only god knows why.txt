I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name
They say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me
It's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay
To be some big shot like I am
Out stretched hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around, yeah
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand 'bout the shit that I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I forgot all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in
And people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So I think I'll keep a walkin'
With my head held high
I'll keep movin' on
And only God knows why
Only God, only God
Only God knows why
Only God knows why, why, why
Only God knows why
Take me to the river, hey
Won't you take me to the river, hey, hey, yeah
