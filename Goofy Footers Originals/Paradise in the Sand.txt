Paradise In the Sand

Chords I-IV-V in F
         F-Bb-C

I had a dream I was on the beach
The sky was blue and clear
I prayed for peace and harmony
But it was already there

I Know you're thinking that I lost my mind
It sounds crazy but I ain't lyin
I guess I found Paradise in the Sand

Cherry Grove ain't far from me
I just couldn't help
But take a ride down to the pier
And see it for myself

I found a home and I found my tribe
It's a great day to be alive
And I guess I found Paradise in the Sand

This morning I was on the beach
I was wide awake
I got peace and harmony
I got sun and waves

Sometimes I still can't believe my eyes
I thank God I'm still alive
And It looks like I found Paradise in the sand

Looks like I found Paradise in the sand
Looks like I found Paradise in the sand
