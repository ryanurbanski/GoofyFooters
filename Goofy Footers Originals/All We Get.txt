Verse 1:
D                    A
Somewhere in between,  the life we live
                  G                D                             
    and the life we leave, is our reality
D                        A
We’re running far behind, of who we are 
               G             D
    and who we could be, our identity

Pre-Chorus:
G                          D                         
But the truth is we’re so much more
    A                     G                           
    Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
    A                         G                   
    A little bit more than we know
                     A     
        If we pay attention
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
    A                           G                          
    With every kindness that we show
                       A                     
        Live with good intentions
G                      A             D 
Cause a little bit of life is all we get       

Verse 2:
D         A 
Ambiguity, whispers in the very 
    G              D
    heart of my morality
D                   A
Something in me sees, the endless waves
        G            D
    of our… our Possibilities

Pre-Chorus:
G                          D                         
But the truth is we’re so much more
    A                     G                           
    Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
    A                         G                   
    A little bit more than we know
                     A     
        If we pay attention
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
    A                           G                          
    With every kindness that we show
                       A                     
        Live with good intentions
G                      A             D 
Cause a little bit of life is all we get

D A G D 

Bridge:
G                         D                        
I know that I must make amends
G                               D                          
For all my fucked up downward trends
G                         D                         
And as you take this recompense
                A              
    Know that I see you

Pre-Chorus:
G                          D                         
But the truth is we’re so much more
    A                     G                           
    Than we give ourselves credit for

Chorus:
D                                 
And a little bit of life will show
    A                         G                   
    A little bit more than we know
                     A     
        If we pay attention
D                                 
And a little bit of love will grow
    A                           G                          
    With every kindness that we show
                       A                     
        Live with good intentions
G                      A             D 
Cause a little bit of life is all we get
