Kook Off the Leash

Verse 1:
Coffee in the morning and a little side of quiche,
Then I go surfing and I never use a leash
My board it don't need a cord when I'm riding down a swell
cus when the waves are big I never, ever bail
... (repeat) he never, ever, bails

Verse 2:
I wear socks with my burkenstocks when I'm skating down the street
My carver can't do carving with a string tied to my feet.
When I play my ukelele I don't ever wear a strap,
I just sit down, and hold it in my lap
--- he holds it, in his lap

Chorus:
Kook off the leash!
Droppin in its a party wave!
Cruisin down the line
He's having one hell of a good time!

Kook off the leash!
Droppin in its a party wave!
Cruisin down the line
He's having one hell of a good time!

Verse 3:
Alas a big wave is closing in on me
I'm gonna get so pitted that it should be a sin.
Instead of standin tall, from my board I fall
Now I'm bobbin in the water like a kook...

Chorus:
Kook off the leash!
Droppin in its a party wave!
Cruisin down the line
He's having one hell of a good time!

Kook off the leash!
Droppin in its a party wave!
Cruisin down the line
He's having one hell of a good time!
