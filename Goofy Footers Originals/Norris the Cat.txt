Norris The Cat

[Verse #1]
E		                
He’ll blow into your life like a hurricane
D	                
Bet your ass you won’t forget his name
A7
Norris the Cat
E
You’ll always wonder where he’s been
D
Who he’s doing and what kind of sin
A7
Norris the cat

Chorus
B7                                        A7
He plays the guitar like he sold his soul
B7                                        A7
If the good die young he’ll never get old
B7                                        A7
I never met a cat that could be so bold
                  E
Norris the cat

[Verse #2]
E				
He wears a tie dye onesie and nothing else
D
He plays well with others and he plays with himself
A7
Norris the Cat
E
He’s a harry mother fucker as you can tell
D
We’re pretty sure he’s going to hell
A7
Norris the Cat



[Chorus #2]
B7                                     A7
People stop and stare when he starts to croon
B7                                      A7
While you’re getting busy he’ll sing you a tune
B7                                      A7
He’s a free-styling tom cat howling at the moon
                          E
He’s Norris the Cat

E
You might think he’s an ass when you first meet
D
Then he’ll tell you you are what you eat
A7
Norris the Cat
E
Thunder Thimble is his pseudonym
D
You can’t help but fall in love with him
A7
Norris the Cat

Chorus #3
B7                                      A7
He’ll steal your food and set your house on fire
B7                                     A7 
Live in your driveway and shit in your tire
B7
He only has one rule
                          E
No pants required

He’s Norris the cat
