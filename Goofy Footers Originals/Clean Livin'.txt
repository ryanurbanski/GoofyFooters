Verse 1:
The doctor says I can't have soda pop
And the whiskey's gonna make my liver rot
I guess I'm just gonna have to put that bottle down

And marijuana smoke don't bother me
But cigarettes make it kinda hard to breathe
And I can't get to sleep unless I'm 
Passed Out on the Ground

Chorus:
Well this here Clean Livin
Is killin me
It's a cold commotion
I do believe
I think I had a plan
But then I got ta thinkin
You're gonna drive me to drinkin
Once again

Verse 2:
Eat right, sleep right, exercise
I take my vitamins and pills at night
I wonder what is virtue without vice?

I'm drinking wheat grass and I'm thinkin thin 
Take a couple more vitamins
And I still can't get to sleep
Get to sleep at night

Well this here Clean Livin...............

Bridge:
I ain't gettin' no younger
And I'm under the gun
I'm taking my time but I'm on the run

Verse 3:
Maybe I'll have myself a couple of kids
And finally settle down
How long can that go on?
And what good is that to anyone?

Scat
SCat
scat a tat tat

Verse 4:
And marijuana smoke still don't bother me
I'll take a toke any time I please
But I still can't get to sleep
Get to sleep at night

This here Clean Livin................
