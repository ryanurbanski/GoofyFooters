Groovy State of Mind

Dirty, old, skunk weed reggae

Verse 1:
D                    
I just gotta lay back
A                     
Gotta find my way back
G                  
Gotta close my eyes
G                
And clear my mind
          D  
And hit reset

Verse 2:
D                      
Gotta kick my shoes off
A                          
Gotta shake these blues off
G                   
I gotta go somewhere
G                 
Where no one cares
              D  
If I’m at my best

Chorus:
Em                         A       
When your world comes tumbling down
                         G      
Put your feet back in the ground

Verse 3:
D                   
Gotta put my feet up
A                     
Gotta light my weed up
G                                              
Gotta spend some time With some friends of mine
                D  
And play some tunes

Verse 4:
D                     
Gotta take the day off
A                    
Gotta find my way off
G                                                
Of this rat race grind Cause I’m starting to find
                     D  
That I’m not in the mood

Chorus:
Em                      A  
There’s more to living life
                      D  
Than working nine to five

Musical interlude:
Em A D

Verse 5:
D                     
Gotta grab a cold beer
A                        
Gotta find my beach chair
G                                        
Gotta sit in the sun Before I come undone
            D  
And lose my way

Verse 6:
D                    
Gotta get my feet wet
A                      
Gotta watch the sun set
G                                  
I’m just a man doing all that I can
                       D  
To make it through the day

Chorus:
Em                             A 
when it comes to spending time 
                            D 
I’m in a groovy state of mind

Instrumental;
D   A   G

Chorus:
Em                       A 
There’s more to living life
                       D 
Than working nine to five
Em                          A 
When it comes to spending time
                          D  
I’m in a groovy state of mind
