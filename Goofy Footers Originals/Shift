My World is Shifting

The Trees are Dancing

We’re Spinning in Circles

And I am Happy

Layer by Layer I’m Shedding

My Old Self Entirely

You won’t even recognize me

I won’t even recognize my own two feet

(Interlude: E  C# E)


My world is shifting

The floor is caving in

It hasn’t been easy

I try to keep breathing

My hands remind me of a song

That doesn’t mean anything at all

To me anymore

We’re learning how to be real

In an unreal world

But I want to be in it

And I’m hardly in it anymore
