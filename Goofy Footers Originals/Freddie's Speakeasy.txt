Blues in A

Verse 1:
Well this town is hot
But the county's dry
There just ain't no place for you to go get high

But if you want some way
To pass the time
Just get in the car, brother, and let's take a drive

Take the dirt road down to Highway 15
You're gonna find something that you ain't never seen

Chorus:
At the speak- easy
Freddie's speak- easy

Verse 2:
They say Freddie was a Russian spy
She's got a tattoo of a dagger on her left thigh
She's got a room upstairs- She'll take you up there
If you happen to catch her eye

And if you happen to need a place to stay the night
She's got a couple of rooms in the back
If you've got the money to pay (and if you need a friend, she's got a couple of them hanging around, too!)

And if you wanna get up, just come on down
We got liquor by the barrel, and love by the pound

Chorus:
At the speak-easy
Freddie's Speak-easy

Ain't no parking lot- it's just a big dirt yard
Baby that's alright with me

Just a couple kids shooting dice And a couple more playing cards
Baby that's alright with me

Just come on down
And get yourself another round




This town is hot
But the county's dry
There just ain't no place for you to go get high

But if you listen real close to what I say
I know the place, yall
Where we can get away

And if you wanna get up, just come on down
We got liquor by the barrel and love by the pound

At the speak-easy
Freddie's speak-easy
Talking bout the speak-easy
Come on down- and shut yo mouth
