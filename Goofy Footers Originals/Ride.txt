Verse 1:
D                 C
It was raining in Chicago
  G                                  D
  when her wheels touched down on Myrtle Beach
D                       C
She had never seen the ocean
  G                               D
  now it was only slightly out of reach

D                 C
She had her family around her
  G                                  D
  how could she want for anything more
D                       C
Until a stranger stood beside her
  G                               D
  said come on girl let's grab a board

Chorus:
D                          C
She had to ride into the ocean
  G             D
  Ride into the sea
D                           C
She had to ride to feel the motion
            G                         C
  With the line in her eyes and the swell on her mind
            G           D
She had to ride to be free

Verse 2:
D                 C
He was born with a purpose
  G                                  D
  a philosopher from Little Rock way
D                       C
He was searching for the answers
  G                               D
  until life took the questions away

D                 C
Becky is his true love
  G                                  D
  they leave their marks on the sand
D                       C
Adapting to life's moments
  G                               D
  they climb the rocks hand in hand

Chorus:
D                          C
She had to ride into the ocean
  G             D
  Ride into the sea
D                           C
She had to ride to feel the motion
            G                         C
  With the line in her eyes and the swell on her mind
            G           D
She had to ride to be free

Bridge:
Em                G
And when I think I've done all that I can
  D                        C
  I look to the waves to try and understand
Em                G
it's not enough to stand where I stand
  D
  got to lend a hand

Chorus:
D                          C
She had to ride into the ocean
  G             D
  Ride into the sea
D                           C
She had to ride to feel the motion
            G                         C
  With the line in her eyes and the swell on her mind
            G           D
She had to ride to be free
