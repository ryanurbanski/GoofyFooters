Verse 1:
  G                      C          
I stared at the sea with pity
G                   C           
Waves blown out and shitty
  G                       C         
I saw her standing by the pier
G                       C           
Said, “Girl, let’s have a beer.”

  D
I should have known what she was about
               D                   D7
    ‘Cause she said no and paddles out

I thought…

Chorus:
         G             C     
May your wetsuit never dry
        G                    C            
May you always have waves to try
  G                   C       
I know I don’t have a chance
                     D        D7
‘Cause only with the wind you dance
         G      C    G               C                  
You’re a surfer girl dreaming of the curl
G              C                     D      
Waves are your world,  ...  are your world

Verse 2:
       G            C  
We collected souvenirs
      G                      C           
As we dated for two and half years
       G                   C         
Costa Rica, California Kauai
         G              C      
Chasing swells we would fly

  D
I knew it would never last,
      D                   D7
    I felt like I was her past

I wrote…

Chorus:
         G             C     
May your wetsuit never dry
        G                    C            
May you always have waves to try
  G                   C       
I know I don’t have a chance
                     D        D7
‘Cause only with the wind you dance
         G      C    G               C                  
You’re a surfer girl dreaming of the curl
G              C                     D      
Waves are your world,  ...  are your world

Bridge:
Bm                 
Your one track mind
A                     
Is truly one of a kind
Bm                    
The only way you’ll be
A                            
Is the swell setting you free

I hope…

Chorus:
         G             C     
May your wetsuit never dry
        G                    C            
May you always have waves to try
  G                   C       
I know I don’t have a chance
                     D        D7
‘Cause only with the wind you dance
         G      C    G               C                  
You’re a surfer girl dreaming of the curl
G              C                     D      
Waves are your world,  ...  are your world
