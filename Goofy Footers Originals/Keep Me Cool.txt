Your wear me out 
But you wear me so well
You keep me cool
As we go through hell

Nothing seems good
Nothing seems right
Nothing ain't nothing
Without you

I’m inside out
And upside down
You scream and shout
Without a sound

Nothing seems good
Nothing seems right
Nothing ain't nothing
Without you

And Roxanne
Roxanne
Roxanne
If you go crazy
If you go crazy
I’ll go with you

And Roxanne
	You keep me cool
Roxanne
	You keep me cool
Roxanne
If you go crazy
Roxanne
If you go crazy
Roxanne
I’ll go with you

I’ll go with you
