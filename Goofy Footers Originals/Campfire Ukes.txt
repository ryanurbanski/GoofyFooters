with friends around the campfire, everyone's high

Verse 1:
G                    D              
September’s ember’s wood in the fire
 C                   G           
Laughter is after time transpired
G                           D        
There’s a choice to smile or to frown
 C                                G         
It’s not a sin to grin when you lo-ok around
G                       D                 
Life is isn’t short, but ain’t long either
 C                          G          
I don’t have time to be an overachiever
G                       D        
It’s as good as you want it to be
 C                     G         
Beauty is here if you want to see

Chorus:
G                 D             
Waves in the day, Music at night

Can’t be unhappy under starlight
G                              D         
We have hurricanes, migraines, people lie

Verse 2:
G                                   D            
But I can find some wood, and I can set it ablaze
 C                        G        
Set up chairs around the smoky haze
G                             D         
My buddy David.. he will strum some song
 C                          G                  
You don’t know the words?  Just grab your phone
G                    D                     
With Luke on the uke plucking a simple tune
 C                       G                 
And everyone... they will swoon to the moon
G                            D               
Butt’s on the chair, but the heart will dance
 C                  G               
Blissfulness if you give it a chance
