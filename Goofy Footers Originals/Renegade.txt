Renegade

Verse 1
Em7
I know it ain’t easy
Am			D
Living life by your own rules
Csus9
Lost at sea and cast away
Em7
On a sinking ship of fools

Solitary footfalls
Am			D
Down the halls of memories
Csus9
Paint the pictures no one sees
Em7
In abstract symmetry 

Chorus

D
A renegade 
Csus9
Running your own race
G
Doing all you can to stay ahead
Csus9
And keep the pace 

D
A renegade
Csus9
Hating your own voice
G
Writing words that never rhyme
Fsus9augG7maj
As if you had a choice

Verse 2
Em7
A soul surfer 
Am
Both feet on your board
D
Living in the pocket
Csus9		Em7
Too present to ignored

Em7
A renaissance man 
Am
still waters run deep
D
In the midnight hour you walk the streets
Csus9			Em7
Too many dreams to sleep

Chorus

A renegade

Running your own race

Doing all you can to stay ahead
Csus9
And keep the pace

Verse 3

Em7
A quiet man of music
Am
Possessing a simple grace
D
Walking the world of madness 
Csus9			Em7
Searching for your place

The beast inside
Am
A wild man in a fucked up place
D
Your smile hides the hunger 
Csus9			Em7
That’s written on your face

Running your own race

Doing all you can to stay ahead
