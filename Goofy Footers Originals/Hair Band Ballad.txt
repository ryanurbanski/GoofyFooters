Intro

Verse 1
G      Cadd9        
I remember yesterday
G     Cadd9                 
We were the youth gone wild.
G       Cadd9           
Love letters in the sand
G      Cadd9           
You and me sweet child.

Verse 2
G           Cadd9           
We thought those times would
never end
G        Cadd9          
A Tommy and Gina lullaby
G        Cadd9                 
You and me and our best friends
G        Cadd9                 
We swore we’d never say goodbye

Pre-Chorus
D        Cadd9          
Vince Neal and Tommy Lee
D        Cadd9                     
Time after time they were there for
Me

Chorus
D          Cadd9            
I don’t know how it happened
D        Cadd9        
I don’t know if I care
D       Cadd9                    
I’m just and old hair rocker baby
G   Cadd9      D     
Slowly losing my hair
Verse 3
G           Cadd9              
Now you don’t know what you got
     GCadd9
til it’s gone
G       Cadd9          
In world without heroes
G           Cadd9             
All I’ve got left is this song

Pre-Chorus
D        Cadd9           
We had Ozzy and Lita Ford
D              Cadd9               
Our lighters raised as we shout out
for more

Chorus
D          Cadd9            
I don’t know how it happened
D        Cadd9        
I don’t know if I care
D       Cadd9                    
I’m just and old hair rocker baby
G   Cadd9      D     
Slowly losing my hair

Bridge
Em       Am         
Don’t stop believing
Em     Am           
Wherever we may roam
Em      Am                  
Cause when I see you smiling
       D        
It takes me home
Cadd9    G 
sweet home

D       Cadd9                    
I’m just and old hair rocker baby

Slowly losing my hair
