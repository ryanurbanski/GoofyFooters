There’s no THC in my CBD
no ADD in my OCD
no ABV in alcohol
Hip hop comes on when you call
No gluten in my bread
I’ll sleep when I am dead

No soul inside of my cell phone
No soul inside of my cell phone
But I stare at it when I’m alone
(Pause)
I stare at my phone when I’m alone

(Musical interlude)

There’s no IBU in my beers
no BFF that’s near
no OMG in my head
Princess Lea is dead
My store has no walls
You text me instead of calls


No soul inside of my cell phone
No soul inside of my cell phone
But I stare at it when I’m alone
(Pause)
I stare at my phone when I’m alone

(Musical interlude)

There’s no lights in the lighthouse
no Potus in the White House
no NFL on TV
There’s nothing to agree
no music on the boob tube
All my videos are on YouTube

No soul inside of my cell phone
No soul inside of my cell phone
But I stare at it when I’m alone
(Pause)
I stare at my phone when I’m alone

(Musical interlude)

There’s no paper in my maps
no love in my apps
no lonely in the night
There’s a pretty girl, swipe right
My brain is like a noodle
All my knowledge is in Google

I wrote this song on my phone
I wrote this song in my phone
I wrote this song when i was alone 
(Pause)
I wrote this song when i was all alone 

(Female starts singing)
In my head, in my head,
Zombie, zombie….
