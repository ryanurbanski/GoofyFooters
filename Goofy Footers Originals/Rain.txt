[Verse 1]
A#                       
Sitting there in my chair
             F
as time goes by
A#                       
Pull the smoke into my lungs
         F
as I get high
A#                       
The sun is set the moon is full 
         F
as I had my way
A#                       
I would drive to your house              
         F
just to say

[Chorus]
F                          
I need you more than water  
A#
I want you more than rain
F                          
I hope you can remember    
A#
that I’ll always feel the same

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
A#        
Sitting there with your wine 
F
You’re  all alone
A#        
From the corner of your eye 
I see your phone
A#        
Should you stay, should you wait 
F
or should you call
A#
It’s hard to do inside this room 
F
when you risk it all

[Chorus]
F                          
I need you more than water  
A#
I want you more than rain
F                          
I hope you can remember    
A#
that I’ll always feel the same

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
F 
I hope this moment last forever 
A#
you and me out in the rain
F 
I drink from you like water
A#
as you wash away my pain

[Chorus]
F                          
I need you more than water  
A#
I want you more than rain
F                          
I hope you can remember    
A#
that I’ll always feel the same

[Chorus]
F                          
I need you more than water  
A#
I want you more than rain
F                          
I hope you can remember    
A#
that I’ll always feel the same

[Outro]
A#  
Standing here by my van
F
Keys in hand
