Verse 1:
A#                                        F               
Sitting there in my chair                  as time goes by
Pull the smoke into my lungs           as I get high
The sun is set the moon is full         as I had my way
I would drive to your house              just to say

Chorus:
F                           A#                           
I need you more than water  I want you more than rain
I hope you can remember    that I’ll always feel the same

Interlude:

Verse 2:
A#                                    F                 
Sitting there with your wine           You’re  all alone
From the corner of your eye            I see your phone
Should you stay  should you wait    or should you call
It’s hard to do inside this room      when you risk it all

Chorus:
F                       A#                           
I need you more than water  I want you more than rain
I hope you can remember    that I’ll always feel the same

Interlude:








Bridge
F                            A#                            
I hope this moment last forever  you and me out in the rain
I drink from you like water           as you wash away my pain

Chorus
F                       A#                           
I need you more than water  I want you more than rain
I hope you can remember    that I’ll always feel the same

Chorus
F                       A#                           
I need you more than water  I want you more than rain
I hope you can remember    that I’ll always feel the same

Outro
A#                F    
Standing here by my van
Keys in hand
