Verse:
D              C                             G                              
Sometimes you feel the earth shift under your feet
         C                        Em	                
And everyone’s a stranger that you meet
         C                         G
Looking for the one thing you can keep
     D
To make life complete

Chorus:
D                   C                    G  	                
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole
            C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
      C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
         D
And play the game
         C
Just give it one more day

Verse:
D                   C                        G  	                
You’re breathing in smoke and it's making you blind
        C                        Em	                
Searching for a different kind of high
       C                     G
Just to be numb would be so sublime
           D
But you dig deep and find

Chorus:
D                   C                        G  	                
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole
            C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
      C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
         D
And play the game
         C
Just give it one more day

Verse:
D          C                             G        	                
So when the day is long and the work is hard
    C                        Em	                
When you feel you haven’t gotten very far
      C                    G
Just look up to the sky and pick a star
 D 
And follow it home
  C
You’re never all alone
                                        
C                   G                                                                 
You’re a piece of the whole
              C                    Em                                       
And every dead end is a different road
         C                            G                                       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
            D
And play the game
               C
Just give it one more day

Verse: 
D           C                             G                              
So when you feel the earth shift under your feet
  C                  Em	                
And everyone’s a stranger that you meet

D
You dig deep and find
C
That you’re one of a kind
G
You’re a piece of the whole
