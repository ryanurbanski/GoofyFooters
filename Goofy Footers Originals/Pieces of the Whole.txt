Verse:
                       D                      A             
Sometimes you feel the earth shift under your feet
                 D                 A     
And everyone’s a stranger that you meet
                D                 A      
Looking for the one thing you can keep
             E    
To make life complete

                    D                         A              
You’re breathing in smoke and it's making you blind
                D                 A      
Searching for a different kind of high
           D                A    
Just to be numb would be so sublime
                     E     
But you dig deep and find

Chorus:
                D                       A      
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole
               C                  A        
And every dead end is a different road
               D                    A       
So pick up the dice and give them a roll
             E      
And play the game
                      D   
Just give it one more day

Verse:
                         D                            A    
You’re feeding all these wounds and it’s bleeding you dry
                D                      A 
looking for the answer to the question why
                D                         A    
searching for a clue but it’s passing you by
                         E 
makes you kneel down and cry

Chorus:
                D                       A      
In every broken heart is a piece of the whole

So when the day is long and the work is hard
                  D                   A         
When you feel you haven’t gotten very far
                    D              A         
Just look up to the sky and pick a star
              E    
And follow it home
                 D     
You’re never all alone

Chorus:
