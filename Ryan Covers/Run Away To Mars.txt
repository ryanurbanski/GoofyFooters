Verse 1:
Your color's fading
'Cause I kept you waiting
It's a wild wild world
And you're a wild wild girl

Our sun's still shining
But it seems half the size
And it's a wild wild world out here

Pre-Chorus:
Before my time runs out

Chorus:
What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end?
If I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

Verse 2:
I can't tell which way is home
I've been gone for so long
It's an empty world up here

I skip stones and wonder
How long 'til I'm discovered?
It's a quiet life up here

Pre-Chorus:
Before my time runs out

Chorus:
What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end?
If I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

Bridge:
Three, two, one, I miss you
I'm sorry I got issues

Chorus:
What If I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end?
If I run out of oxygen
When I run away to Mars
